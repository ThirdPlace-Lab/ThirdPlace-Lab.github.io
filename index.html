    <h1>Hello, this is ThirdPlace Lab.</h1>
  <p>
    ThirdPlace Lab is a work in progressâ€”a laboratory structured as an association to support researchers working outside traditional university or industry labs.
    Our mission is to give individuals a chance to lead their own research projects while upholding a high standard of excellence. 
    We explore alternative funding sources and emphasize transparency, as we open-source the whole research pipeline (from code and processes, to article and resulting datasets). Additionally, we experiment with interactive, web-based formats to showcase research results in engaging and accessible ways.
