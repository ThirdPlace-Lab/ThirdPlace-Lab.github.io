    <h1>Hello, this is the work in progress that is ThirdPlace Lab.</h1>
    <p>
      ThirdPLace Lab aims to be a laboratory working as an association, helping researches outside of standard university or industrial laboratories.
      We aim to bring back research in the hand of individuals, while maintaining the same level of excellence.
      From alternative fundings, to interactive ways to display the result of research, we're aiming to be an exploration space to see how we could rethink the research world.
